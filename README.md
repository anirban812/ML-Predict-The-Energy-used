Modern economies depend on the reliable and affordable delivery of electricity. Yet many places in the world are still affected by power outages.

One significant cause of power outages is overloading. Overloading occurs when too much power is drawn from an electric circuit at once. This can be avoided if we know when excess electricity is going to be used. Heating and cooling appliances consume the most power in a household.

In this challenge, we try to predict the electricity usage of heating and cooling appliances in a household based on internal and external temperatures and other weather conditions. Each observation measures electricity in a 10-minute interval. The temperatures and humidity have been averaged for 10-minute intervals.
